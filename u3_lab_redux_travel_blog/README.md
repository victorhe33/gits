Now that we have worked with the React Redux library, lets put it to use in creating a mock travel blog site where users are able to add comments on different posts. We will be building up a Redux front end, connected to an Express / Mongo backend, where users are able to add comments to posts of popular travel locations.

## Requirements:

- A Full Stack MERN app built with React Redux, Express, and MongoDB
- Your site should display posts of popular travel locations, in which users can comment and add reviews to
- User interactivity with forms and buttons on our Front End to add reviews, comments, and likes
- A back end with at least 2 models (posts & comments)

- Though we are working in groups, we want all group members coding along and building up their apps, not having one person in the group code while the others sit back. By the end of the day, each person should have a completed full stack project. 

## Recommendations

- Be sure to use your notes and previous labs as a resource to help you through this challenge
- ERDs, Component Hierarchy Diagrams, and calls to Insomnia will not be required, but will be very, very highly recommended
