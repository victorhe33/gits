## Task

Your task is to work as a team to build a full-stack `Postresql/Express/React/Node` application with a functioning backend and frontend with user authentication.
Try to think about building an application that will create an engaging user experience and be creative in your concept.

## For Project Approval

- Detailed ReadMe (Name, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used)
- Full Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) for the backend
- Component Hierarchy Diagram (Lucidchart, draw.io, etc.) for the frontend
- Trello Board that tells the development story of your app
- Pitch deck explaining your idea and it's practical use-case (Google Slides, Powerpoint, etc.) to be presented by your group on Friday (April 15th)
- Project must be _well-scoped_, meaning that your team can capably reach MVP by the due date (April 22nd)

## Project Approval Due Date: Friday, April 15th @ 9AM EST

## Project Requirements (MVP)

**Your project must:**
- Be setup in **two new repos** (one for backend, one for front end) with *separate development branches* for **each** group member.
- Be a **realistic idea**. It cannot be anything we've created in class. It also cannot be from an online tutorial or walkthrough.
- Include a _beautiful_, professional **ReadMe.md** (use [markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)).
- Your ReadMe should have your group members names, links to socials, a detailed description of your project, technologies used, a getting started section (with links to your deployed site and Trello), screenshots of your final product (no more than 2-3), future updates, and credits.
- Include a minimum of 3 Sequelize Models (models).
- At least one `1 to MANY` or `MANY to MANY` association.
- Have full CRUD operations (POST, GET, PUT, DELETE) on at least one model.
- Integrate User Authentication with JWT and utilize protected routes on the frontend.
- Have at least **80 _meaningful_ `git` commits** - roughly 20+ per member utilizing branches and merging. You should be committing your changes to your branch every time you build a new feature, merging, and pulling them as a group.
- Your code should be properly indented, spaced, and within code blocks. **DO NOT** leave in commented out code that was left unused (bad practice). 
- Both repos deployed on [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/).

## Project Due Date: Friday, April 22nd @ 130PM EST

## Post-MVP Ideas
- Integrate a 3rd party API: https://github.com/public-apis/public-apis
- Integrate a UI Library (Semantic, Material-UI, React-MD, react-rainbow, r-suite)
- Integrate Mapbox or Geolocation: https://docs.mapbox.com/api/
- Implement Data Visualization or Charting: https://dev.to/giteden/top-5-react-chart-libraries-for-2020-1amb

## Tips
- Research what you consider the best websites out there to get ideas/inspiration.
- Decide who will be git lead in your group and start brainstorming as soon as possible.
- Commit early (day one) and often (everytime you implement a new feature).
- Implement all project requirements first before moving on to post-mvp features.
- Make it look professional (this is for you to showcase on your portfolio - it could land you a job).

## A Note on Plagiarism
  
- Plagiarism is a serious offense and grounds for immediate withdrawal.
- You are encouraged to ask others, including students, instructors, and Stack Overflow for help. However, it is <b><i>not acceptable to copy</i></b> another persons code and submit it as your own. More importantly, it is detrimental to your learning and growth.
- Small snippets of code that solve small problems taken from Stack Overflow are generally an exception to this rule. If you aren't sure, it is your responsibility to <b><i>ask your instructor</i></b>. To be on the safe side, we ask that you credit the person/resource you got the code from in a comment, and let an instructor take a look at it.
