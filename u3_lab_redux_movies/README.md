## Overview
We'll be building a React app that uses a movie and TV API!  We'll use Redux and Thunk to manage our state.

## Getting Started
- `fork` and `clone`
- `npm i` to install our dependencies
- `npm install axios redux react-redux redux-thunk` to install the middleware we'll need
- Create a services directory. It should contain all of your axios requests.
- Create a components directory.
- Set up your store, reducers, types, and actions.

## Initial Setup
We'll be building a React app utilizing the `TMDB V3` API found **[here](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction)**.

Sign up for an account and create an API key. Store the API key in a `.env` file for this lab. Remember, React env variables must have `REACT_APP` prepending whatever you call your environment variable. You can either use `react-router` or build a single page app utilizing multiple components.
