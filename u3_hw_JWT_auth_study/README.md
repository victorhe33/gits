## A Note on Passwords

We **never** store passwords in our database. Instead, we use a hashing function to create a password hash or digest. We store the password digest in our database.

## JSON Web Token (JWT) Authentication

Here is a flow for using JWT for Authentication

1. The user signs up:

- The client creates a POST request to the `/signup` endpoint on the server with username, email, and password in the request body

2. The server creates a JSON Web Token (JWT) based on a header, payload, and secret
3. The server responds with the JWT
4. The client saves the JWT in localStorage to persist subsequent server requests

{
  "id": "1",
  "username": "bruno",
  "email": "bruno@ga.co"
}
```
